[A Brief History of Cloud Computing](https://medium.com/threat-intel/cloud-computing-e5e746b282f5)

'Cloud computing' has been one of the larger buzzwords in the tech industry. I knew it was big but I didn't really know what it was used for other than stuff like Google Drive or Dropbox. This article was interesting because it talked about how the use of the 'cloud' has developed throughout the years and gave modern examples, most famously Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS provides essential services to many tech giants such as hosting virtual servers, processing power, or analytic software. It really surprised me that so many services can be run through cloud technology. With these services becoming widespread products, it will certainly further lower the barriers to entry in the tech industry, leading to even greater innovation in tech and software engineering.


Personally I believe that blockchain technologies with smart contract layers will replace cloud computing services as they can perform the same functions without the same costs and 3rd party trust required. -Nikita Mokhov
